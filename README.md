# Project14-Whack-a-Penguin
## The objective of this project is to have a game made for iPads only. 
## SK actions, GCD and closures will be learned.

# Challenge
## Record your own voice saying "Game over!" and have it play when the game ends.
## When showing “Game Over” add an SKLabelNode showing their final score.
## Use SKEmitterNode to create a smoke-like effect when penguins are hit, and a separate mud-like effect when they go into or come out of a hole.
